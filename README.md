# 2-ENC28j60-in-Raspberry
This repository shows how configure two modules enc28j60 to raspberry. This was made in my final project degree where a Raspberry Pi Zero needed two ethernet interficies: one to be connected directly to a PLC, and another to connect the RPI to the LAN. The pourpose of this two interfaces were that the PLC had to be unreacheble from the LAN.
